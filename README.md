# Web-Scraping-Challenge

In this challenge, I created a jupyter notebook to test all the scrapping steps. Then I transferred the data to a python file where I debugged the program. The final products is an html site with a button that calls another site to run the scrape function, scraping 4 different sites and refreshing the data in the index everytime is pressed.
